# 📊 Adobe Technical Support Analytics Dashboard

## 🧩 Problem Statement

In a fast-paced technical support environment, maintaining high agent performance, ensuring timely resolution of customer issues, and delivering superior customer satisfaction are critical to operational success. Adobe’s Technical Support team receives a high volume of support cases daily across multiple departments such as Acrobat and Photoshop. The team needs a comprehensive and interactive dashboard to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), track attendance trends, evaluate AI-driven upselling success, and understand customer satisfaction levels in depth.

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a two-page interactive analytics dashboard using Power BI that allows Adobe’s Technical Support leadership and analysts to:

1. Evaluate **agent performance and attendance** across different departments and time frames.
2. Monitor **case resolution efficiency and AI conversion success** to improve upselling strategy.
3. Gain deep insights into **customer satisfaction and issue patterns** to enhance service quality.
4. Enable **dynamic filtering and slicing** of the data to support ad-hoc analysis and decision-making.
